## Description 
This virtual portfolio is deployed to netlify to showcase my various projects, and work that I've worked on since starting the bootcamp course that I joined in November of 2024. It has basic routing to varying pages, minimalistic styling, and the ability to download a resume (it is currently a placeholder).
